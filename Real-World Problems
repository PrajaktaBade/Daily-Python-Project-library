Problem statement:  To create a Python program that alters an Excel file by adding a new column to it.
Write a Python program that:
          Loads the Excel file as a Pandas dataframe or similar.
          Adds a new column named Total to the data.
          The data of the Total column should be a product of the Price column and the Quantity column (i.e., Price x Quantity).
          Generates an output.xlsx file that contains the original data and the new Total column.
